# Website Landing Page: An Introductory CSS Project

## Overview

This project forms part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations Course. Following the lessons on basic HTML and CSS, you are tasked with replicating a pre-designed website landing page based on provided images (found in the 'desired-outcome' folder). This is my attempt to complete the project.

The aim of the project is to practice utilising the various aspects of HTML and CSS learned thus far in the course, with particular emphasis on utilising CSS Flexbox to influence the layout of the webpage.
